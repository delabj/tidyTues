## Fetching the data/setup
As always I begin by fetching the data from the tidytuesday repo. 

### Packages:
These are the package I plan on using today:

+ tidyverse (It's what this is all about)
+ spotifyr (Extra data from spotify's API)
+ ggtext (A wonderful package by [@ClausWilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke) that enables better control over text rendering)
+ patchwork (By the amazing [@thomasp85](https://twitter.com/thomasp85) allows for easy combining of plots)
+ janitor (makes it easy to clean the names of a data set.)
+ forcats (easy work with factors)
